# Dotfiles
This repository holds the dotfiles I use.

**Dotfiles** are the typical UNIX configuration files used for customization of our programs or tools, like the shell `.bashrc`/`.zsh` or vim editors `.vimrc`.

They are name like that because of the leading `.` and are hidden on your file system.
